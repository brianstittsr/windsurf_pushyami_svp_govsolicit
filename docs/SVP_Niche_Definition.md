## What is a Niche?

### Definition

A **niche** is a specialized segment of the market for a particular kind of product or service. In business terms, it represents:

> **"The specific area of focus where your company can deliver exceptional value to a well-defined group of customers better than anyone else."**

### Key Characteristics of a Strong Niche

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Specificity** | Clearly defined boundaries that distinguish you from generalists |
| **Expertise** | Deep knowledge and capabilities in the chosen area |
| **Demand** | A real market need that customers are willing to pay for |
| **Defensibility** | Barriers that make it difficult for competitors to replicate |
| **Profitability** | Sufficient margin and volume to sustain the business |
| **Passion** | Alignment with what your team genuinely cares about |

### Why Niche Matters (According to Traction/EOS)

In the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), your niche is part of your **Core Focus**—the combination of your Purpose (why you exist) and your Niche (what you do best and who you serve). A well-defined niche:

- **Focuses resources** on what you do best
- **Attracts ideal customers** who value your expertise
- **Repels wrong-fit customers** who would drain resources
- **Guides decisions** about what opportunities to pursue
- **Differentiates you** from competitors

## Examples of SVP Niches by Service Line

### Niche Example 1: OEM Supplier Qualification

| **Our Unique Value** | End-to-end qualification support from gap analysis to approved supplier status |
| **Outcome** | Qualified supplier status with target OEM within 12-18 months |

**Example Client Scenario:**

### Niche Example 2: ISO/QMS Certification

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who We Serve** | Manufacturers needing ISO 9001, IATF 16949, AS9100, or ISO 13485 certification |

| **Our Unique Value** | Hands-on implementation (not just documentation), guaranteed certification |
| **Outcome** | Certification achieved in 6-12 months with sustainable systems |

**Example Client Scenario:**
> A 150-employee medical device contract manufacturer in Minnesota needs ISO 13485 certification to retain a major customer. They've failed two previous certification attempts with other consultants. SVP implements a practical QMS that passes certification on the first attempt.

| **Outcome** | Connected, data-driven operations with measurable ROI |

**Example Client Scenario:**
