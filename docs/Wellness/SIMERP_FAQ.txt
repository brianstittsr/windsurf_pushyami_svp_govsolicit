SIMERP FAQ's

FOUNDATION - WHAT SIMERP IS:

▸
What is SIMERP and how can it save me money on taxes?

▸
How do you come up with the pre-tax deduction amount - is that just a random number?

▸
How is a SIMERP different from just paying for health insurance with pre-tax dollars?
SIMERP's pre-tax salary reduction is fundamentally different from insurance premium payments because it operates under IRC Section 125 cafeteria plan authority rather than IRC Section 106 premium exclusion rules.

Insurance premiums pay for coverage that might provide benefits if claims occur, while SIMERP's pre-tax deduction funds actual medical care and wellness services that are guaranteed to be provided.

This distinction is critical because it allows SIMERP to operate as a medical expense reimbursement arrangement under IRC Section 105(b) rather than insurance, avoiding complex insurance regulations while providing immediate, tangible value to all participants.

The pre-tax deduction creates the funding mechanism for services that employees actually receive, not coverage for potential future benefits.

SIMERP CORE COMPLIANCE - WHY IT'S LEGAL:

▸
Is SIMERP legal? What gives you the authority to do this?

▸
How do I know the IRS won't challenge SIMERPs and say the reimbursements are taxable income?

▸
What evidence supports that the SIMERP reimbursement approach is professionally sound and won't get challenged?

▸
What tax laws does SIMERP comply with and how do you ensure it stays compliant?

▸
Why does SIMERP focus on providing actual services instead of just insurance coverage?

▸
Do employees have to use the services every month to justify the monthly tax savings?

▸
How do you prevent SIMERP from being seen as just a tax avoidance scheme?

▸
How does SIMERP work with our existing employee benefits and cafeteria plan?

▸
Are there restrictions on which employees can participate in a SIMERP? Can we exclude part-time or seasonal workers?

▸
Can employees use their tax savings to buy additional insurance or benefits?
Supplemental benefits available through SIMERP are purchased by employees with after-tax dollars, typically funded by the employees' tax savings generated by the SIMERP program.

Enrolled employees save approximately $2,136-$5,124 annually in taxes through SIMERP, and a portion of these savings can be used to purchase additional voluntary benefits like enhanced life insurance, disability coverage, or critical illness insurance.

These supplemental benefits are treated as taxable compensation to employees but provide valuable additional protection funded by their own tax savings rather than additional out-of-pocket costs. The result is that these supplemental benefits are funded by the employee with post-tax dollars.

While employers could choose to fund supplemental benefits using their $1,120 per employee payroll tax savings, the typical SIMERP structure allows employees to use their substantial tax savings to enhance their benefits package, creating a comprehensive protection portfolio with improved net financial position.

What are the risks of implementing this program and how are they managed?
SIMERP presents minimal risk due to its conservative structure, extensive IRS precedent foundation, and comprehensive professional administration.

Regulatory risk is minimal because SIMERP follows identical methodology to dozens of accepted IRS standardized valuations and operates well within established precedent with professional actuarial certification.

Operational risk is low due to technology-driven compliance systems and automatic correction procedures. Financial risk is minimal due to the conservative 75% methodology, professional liability coverage, and comprehensive indemnification protections.
